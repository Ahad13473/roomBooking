# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# names = ["Diamond", "Ruby", "Zirconia"]

# names.each do |name|
#     Room.create(name: name)
# end

# slots = ["0800", "0900", "1000", "1100"]
# Room.all.each do |room|
#  slots.each do |slot|
#     Slot.create(room_id: room.id, time: slot)
#  end
# end
